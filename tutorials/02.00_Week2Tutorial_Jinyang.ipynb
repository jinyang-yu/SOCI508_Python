    "In this notebook we will together walk through the examples and exercises in [*Python for Everybody* Chapter 2](https://www.py4e.com/html3/02-variables) [*Python for Everybody* Chapter 3](https://www.py4e.com/html3/03-conditional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Goals:\n",
    "* Run some Python code! Understand what is happening when you run code in Jupyter\n",
    "* Better understand what a varible is in Python, what an expression is, and what a statement it.\n",
    "* Understand variable types in Python\n",
    "* Better understand how Python carries out mathematical calculations\n",
    "* Get more comfortable writing, manipulating, and running Python code in Jupyter\n",
    "* Begin to construct more sophisticated programs by using logical operators and conditional executions\n",
    "* Get more comfortable with the logic of Python, how it processes code, and how you can get it to do what you want it to do. How do you give your Python puppy the correct instructions? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder 1:** This is a LOT to take in. The goal is to provide you with the basic vocabularly you need to understand and use Python. We will practice all of these skills throughout the semester. *You are not expected to understand and remember everything presented right now. Through practice, it will become more and more familiar. Go easy on yourself these first few weeks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder 2:** We all use Google when we code. You will too. But try not to for the first few week. Most importantly, *never run code you don't understand.* Python is a real programming language and it has access to your computer (if you give it access). You can run code that wipes your hard drive, and you will NEVER be able to recover it. *Friends don't let friends run code they don't understand.*"

    "Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, `2 \\* (3-1)` is `4`, and `(1+1)\\*\\*(5-2)` is `8`. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn't change the result.\n",

    "Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so `2\\*\\*1+1` is `3`, not `4`, and `3\\*1\\*\\*3` is `3`, not `27`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So `2\\*3-1` is `5`, not `4`, and `6+4/2` is `8.0`, not `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right. So the expression `5-3-1` is `1`, not `3`, because the `5-3` happens first and then `1` is subtracted from `2`.\n",
