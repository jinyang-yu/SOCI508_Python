    "# Introduction to Natural Language Processing using NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many features of natural languages that are remarkably difficult to get a computer to identify. Much early NLP work was around structuring text according to how it functions as a natural language, not a series of characters as computers read text. Python's NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit) bundles a bunch of these early tools together for us on text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder of where we are\n",
    "\n",
    "* values (e.g. `1.2`, `100`, `'Hello, Boston!'`)\n",
    "* value types (e.g., `float`, `int`, `string`)\n",
    "* variables, or objects (for storing and referencing values)\n",
    "* operators (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`)\n",
    "* logical operators (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`)\n",
    "* statements and expressions (e.g. `10 + 500`)\n",
    "* built-in functions (e.g. `print()`, `type()`)\n",

    "* user-defined functions (using `def`)\n",

    "* *pre-processing*\n",
    "    * Transforming a human lanugage text into computer-manipulable format. A typical pre-processing workflow includes <i>stop-word</i> removal, setting text in lower case, and <i>term frequency</i> counting.\n",
    "* *token*\n",
    "    * An individual word unit within a sentence.\n",
    "* *stop words*\n",
    "    * The function words in a natural langauge, such as <i>the</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>it</i>, etc. These are typically the most common words.\n",
    "* *term frequency*\n",
    "    * The number of times a term appears in a given text. This is either reported as a raw tally or it is <i>normalized</i> by dividing by the total number of words in a text.    \n",
    "* *POS tagging*\n",
    "    * One common task in NLP is the determination of a word's part-of-speech (POS). The label that describes a word's POS is called its <i>tag</i>. Specialized functions that make these determinations are called <i>POS Taggers</i>.\n",
    "* *dependency parsing*\n",
    "    * THe grammatical relationships between words and the type of relationships.\n",
