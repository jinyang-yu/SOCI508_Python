    "The purpose of this notebook is to introduce you to the features of Jupyter, running code in Jupyter, formatting nice text in Jupyter, and uploading notebooks to Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Goals:\n",
    "* Get comfortable opening a Jupyter notebook and running cells\n",
    "* Learn the features and function in the Jupyter IDE (Interactive Programming Environment)\n",
    "* Run some Python code! Understand what is happening when you run code in Jupyter\n",
    "* Learn the basics of Markdown and use it to format text\n",
    "* Submit your completed notebook to Canvas for credit\n",
    "    1. Rename this file and include your name in the filename\n",

    "**Reminder 1:** The first few weeks will be a LOT to take in. The goal is to provide you with the basic vocabularly you need to understand and use Python. We will practice all of these skills throughout the semester. *You are not expected to understand and remember everything presented right now. Through practice, it will become more and more familiar. Go easy on yourself these first few weeks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder 2:** We all use Google when we code. You will too. But try not to for the first few week. Most importantly, *never run code you don't understand.* Python is a real programming language and it has access to your computer (if you give it access). You can run code that wipes your hard drive, and you will NEVER be able to recover it. *Friends don't let friends run code they don't understand.*"

    "Jupyter notebooks consist of cells. The cell we're reading now is formatted as a \"Markdown\" cell, and is used for text. How do we know it's a markdown cell? Look at the top of the window for a dropdown menu with options such as `Code`, `Markdown`, etc. Click on this cell and that dropdown menu should say `Markdown`.\n",

    "You can run Markdown cells, but more typically you will be running code cells. Running code, or other cells, in a Jupyter notebook is relatively easy. Click on the cell you wish to run. A call is a segment of text or code. The cell you're currently 'in' will be outlined in blue. Once you've clicked on your desired cell then either click the \"Play\" button in the toolbar above the code window or press CTRL+RETURN on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",

    "* If you modify a notebook and you're happy with the modifications, create a checkpoint by saving the notebook. Look for the hard disk icon on the top left. This should look familiar to people who have used Word.\n",
